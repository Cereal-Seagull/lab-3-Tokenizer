# Lab 1
Implements a doubly linked list (DLL) in DLL.cs and general utility functions in GeneralUtils.cs.

DLL class contains a DNode class that tracks the value and pointers of a node in
a DLL. DLL class also contains several methods for accessing specific elements of
the list, adding and removing elements, and other miscellaneous methods.

DLL.cs implements the IList<T> interface which contains methods to add, remove, and index items
along with a method to fill an array with the DLL's contents. DLL.cs also implements the IEnumerable<T> interface.

There is a DLLTest.cs file that contains xUnit tests for all methods in the DLL.cs file. These tests
are generated by Claude but human reviewed.
